  my morality is future-proof we often think about how morality has changed over time .,"if you brought back a king from iron age israel they would be fine with the exploitation of humans . my contention is that my own morality is future-proof for at least the next 1000 years contingent upon us not being taken over by a superintelligent ai . it seems to me that the history of morality is best demonstrated by the sphere of things we care about increasing from the tribe to the country and finally to the world . as such , we should care about every human being equally . practically , yes , i do little to physically act upon it , but i view this in the same way that we do not harshly view upon anti-slavery advocates who did not literally kill the masters and free slaves . i think that i do a good job of promoting my mentality and currently i do not have a relevant income stream due to my youth but i plan on donating to charities once i do . secondly , i am vegetarian , and i think that is the next evident horror that will be slowly fought against as humans realize it is disgusting to slaughter conscious creatures to appease their taste buds . i also do n’t think anything else matters besides the flourishing of sapient beings , so as such , a self-aware ai or simulation of a human brain deserves as much consideration morally as a human . while i can not predict crazy backwards changes in morality , i would assign a 50 % probability that my views do n’t become outdated within a 1,000 years ."
Counter-1:,"i think that i do a good job promoting my view and now, i have the ability to be a vegetarian and benefit society as a whole as much as a human would. however, i want to address a different issue. i agree that we should not condone cruelty of the animals. that being said, we are morally neutral to other things, like human society. we do not condone killing innocent people or animals, or any species. if a chicken could live, it would be perfectly fine."
Counter-2:,"i do n't think it 's fair to say that you do n't want to live in a civilized society , but i think you 're missing the point of the discussion . i think it is important to remember that we are all human beings , and that is what we have now . it 's not that we do n't live in an ideal world , it 's that we live in the same situation as everyone else . we are not a threat to our ancestors . we do not live in a"

Counter-1:,"so this is where the real problem is for you. that we're in a very difficult legal case, and your'opinion'is getting ignored. i don't think we've ever actually had this discussion. i don't think it's fair to expect people to understand the consequences of our policies, without a good enough reason. if you want someone to understand then clearly that it's reasonable to expect people to."
Counter-2:,"there 's a lot of talk about this , but it 's not a huge stretch of the imagination . it 's a very small piece of the puzzle . he 's not going to be able to do anything about it , but he does n't have to worry about the consequences of his campaign promises . he is n't going to do that , and he 's going to have to do something about it . i think it 's pretty easy to say that it 's just as easy to think of him as a politician ."

  there is no legitimate argument against resolving climate change .,"i do n’t believe there is but let ’s take for granted that there is . i ’m saying that there ’s no reason not to resolve it . after talking to many of my family who are climate deniers and working backwards the argument seems to boil down to “ the left wants to solve climate change so i oppose that ” let ’s take for granted that climate change is n’t caused by humans or is n’t real at all and then continue to ask “ why not take the steps necessary to solve it ? ” the worst case scenario from where i stand is that the conservatives are right , climate change is n’t real and the air is cleaner and we are n’t going to run out of fuel before the next century . i do n’t see a reason not to . the other arguments seem to be “ it seems hard ” which is n’t really a reason and “ it ’ll trash the economy ” which is being debunked by the nations who are taking steps and not seeing this happen to their economy ."
Counter-1:,"well, i actually have a few on this one, but it's just because i'm familiar with climate change. it could just be something the us government does and they do it anyway. it seems like you're dealing with pretty bad arguments here. this is the first major issue that i've heard from people about'if the us wants to solve this problem, we ought to do so '. and it may sound crazy, but i think you have a pretty solid reason to believe that the us government has a huge amount of power."
Counter-2:,"i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that we should n't have to worry about the consequences of our actions , but rather that we do n't want to do something about it . i think we should do it , but it 's not the only thing we can do . we 're not going to be able to do anything about it , we just do n't know what it 's like to do . you do n't need to know what 's going on in the world , and what you 're doing is"

Counter-1:,"would you prefer to have a law specifically prohibiting pedophiles from being sexually attracted to young people of their own race? that has never been the case in human history. it seems to me that you seem to be expecting something from a society where the criminal justice system has never worked, where pedophiles and pedophiles are put to death, the government has never been able to protect them from any of this, and there have been some pretty damaging consequences of this behavior throughout history. can you be more specific in your assertions?"
Counter-2:,"i think it 's fair to say that the state should have a right to do whatever they want with their own bodies , but i do n't think it should be illegal to do so in a way that does n't infringe on the rights of others in the first place . i think that 's a very slippery slope . it 's just a matter of perspective . i do not think it is fair to deny someone 's right to bodily autonomy if they do n't want to . it is a slippery slope to me ."

"  on abortions personally , i think the government should not subsidize abortions at all .","i think the doctor should negotiate a fee with the patient or go through insurance ( if they 'll pay for abortion ) like any other medical procedure done . secondly , since an abortion is basically the mother opting out of motherhood , i believe the father should be able to opt out of fatherhood as well . during the same time period where a pregnant girl can abort the unborn baby , the father can choose to opt out by signing a form releasing all parental rights to the baby . ( i do n't know how it would work where the woman does not tell the father about the pregnancy until after the baby is born . but i 'm sure politicians or someone on reddit can come up with a decent solution to it ) third , since mothers can abort an unborn baby without any criminal punishment ( murder ) ; a person who kills a pregnant woman and thus the unborn baby , that person should not be charged with a murder of the unborn baby who is still within that time frame of being aborted ."
Counter-1:,"the government shouldn't pay for abortion either. it may be possible, but one of the most effective methods to prevent murder and murder is through social contract. the government shouldn't force people to marry to have an abortion. the mother will not be forced to engage in violence. you can't just force people to marry to have an abortion. you can't force people to keep carrying the same number of children."

"" i do not believe this ; in fact , i find it extremely childish to even think something like this . yet , considering affirmative action has failed in its goal , i feel like changing affirmative action would help certain individuals in this country feel like x race is not out to get them and maybe reduce the amount of negative racial discourse in this country . i am generally a very liberal person and really do want my mind changed regarding this . i just feel like it is really hard to justify why black person x should get the bill gates scholarship over white person y when they came from similar economical areas and the income of their families is similar . i understand that example is not affirmative action per se , but i feel like the same principal applies ."
Counter-1:,"because this person may or may not be black, yet we have the affirmative action in action, as well as the freedom of speech, right to express your opinion. so just because one race has caused those other races to feel black, that does not mean the world should. we can say'we shouldn't make white people feel black'because it's because it's not democratic, its a political position, and you should be defending it. that's racist. that said, i understand why a minority views affirmative action as unfair treatment."

  black people can be racist towards white people this came from an argument i had with a friend .,"they were arguing about how black people could n't be racist to white people because white people were the ones with power ( in usa ) . i guess they were going off the racism definition of prejudice + power . i was going off the definition of oxford dictionary which says racism is "" prejudice , discrimination , or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one 's own race is superior .

Counter-1:,"this is why it is bad for you to speak of people's belief system with discrimination. racism does nothing to help that the average black person cannot be racist towards the majority race. so when you claim that black people can't be racist towards the minority race, then we should expect that some black people can be racist against that minority race just as much. the problem is not prejudice itself, but racism itself. that's a real problem, but it is not a serious problem."

  privacy is overrated and we should not fear its demise .,"however , i think many problems today occur because of privacy , both because of the sneaky business itself and also because of shame related responses to it . for example , some terrible crimes have been committed as a result of the presumption of privacy rights . i recently listened to a podcast ( fbi retired case file review ) that discussed the enron criminal case . clearly , enron ’s criminally convicted executives would not have been able to destroy the value of share holder stocks if all their trades had been open , public records . additionally , there have been many instances of hypocritical behavior from policy makers who do one thing in public while doing the opposite in their privacy protected private lives . further , shame about personal stuff has caused people to destroy themselves with self loathing . ( alternatively , you could argue that the absence of privacy would prevent many kinds of bad behavior but , for the moment , i am acknowledging that sympathy of people who rely on privacy is not entirely out of place ) . finding out what your coworkers make or your boss makes in income would be a huge asset to working people , too . is privacy worth the trouble ?"
Counter-1:,"the answer to the above questions is, yes. but the problem with your op is that its usually about the assumption that people have a view differently than you do. so far, there has been very little evidence that privacy is worth the trouble. that's what protects privacy. a lot of people see privacy as something other than an object or thing. you can have it, but it doesn't make it any less damaging for someone."

Counter-1:,"i agree with this, but i'm pretty sure that you're trying to be a bit more precise with what you're trying to say. killing someone just for the sake of killing a friend is not voluntary. so why do people feel that killing someone because of their belief that you must kill them is the best thing to do to them? why must we coerce people into following suit? is killing people a choice?"

Counter-1:,"i think you're missing the point. states have rights to the 2nd amendment. states have the congress and the senate. in dc, federal powers are supposed to protect the 2nd amendment from the government. states don't have to obey a federal court order to enforce a private law. in dc, the courts are supposed to enforce a private law."

Counter-1:,"what does this mean? why do you care what other people think? does voter participation imply that trump doesn't care about mexicans being racist? it doesn't seem to imply that he does. i'll just say that it is possible to judge whether or not the show's actions are actually representative of the current republican republican party, who has been known to be racist or intolerant towards americans."

Counter-1:,"what about pedophiles who are, in fact, on the list as well? they are still with society, if they were not at the lgbt. they have support, support and support from others of their gender, religion, and race. also, they have psychological problems that they are not willing to acknowledge. people who are attracted to these are less likely to take part in these activities, as we assume they would take part in the activity. so while i don't agree that you can force pedophiles to do these things, i don't think any reasonable person would say no to them."

' bastard ' , meaning a child who was born out of wedlock , is effectively the same level of insult . a person ca n't choose whether they are born to married parents , and using it as an insult on anyone will be offensive only to actual bastards , as again it implies ' bastards ' are worse people ."
Counter-1:,"the fact that the usage of the word,'faggot ', means'child who was born out of wedlock '. you also seem to have an implication that a word like'bastard'means something less than that. what you need to learn is that, to say that, the word is'faggot'or'homosexual'doesn't mean that, just that, if something is offensive, it's offensive. you could use'nigger'to mean'son who was born in wedlock '."

Counter-1:,"income inequality is precisely because of the fact that rich people have a vested interest in having a bunch of money in the first place, which leads to great wealth inequality. if you are poor but poor you have no incentive to live. by providing good quality goods and services, you are able to contribute to society better than most poor people. you're basically doing something that is expected of you, which is a wonderful trait. i think the problem is that you should at least be able to be generous towards someone without expecting to be rewarded."

  the news should be split into two types of channels ; news and debate .,"many networks have the 2-5 person panels right after delivering the news where they debate the issue usually talking over each other in a way that ends up unintelligible . i believe that there should be one set of channels that are strictly fact-based news where they give the details , facts , and figures and do their best to not voice their opinions on the matter . ( ex : at 05:45 pst iraq sent a force of around 5,000 soldiers into syria . al-assad put out this statement . currently , there is no statement from the white house on this issue ) the other set of channels ( can be run by the same companies ) is the actual 1v1 or panel discussions about that news and the pros and cons of each side of the issue . the main reason i think the current type of "" person telling the news is also debating it "" style is that they are arguing their opinion and it 's sometimes difficult for some to see where the facts end and the opinions begin when it 's not clearly defined ."
Counter-1:,"i've spent the last 8 months debating the topic before i even read the piece. it was a little more complicated. the two are talking about the facts that can be argued if they look at the facts that're presented. the main argument you're trying to talk about is to try and weigh the pros and cons to see which come to an equally large view. while it may be difficult, both of those options are a little easier to come by and it helps to know what makes you think that a different set of options is preferable."

  the term ‘ racist ’ has been successfully neutralized .,"there was probably a time where being called a racist had moral and social consequences . my guess is that this accusation had more meaning around wwii when most people wanted to condemn hitler and the nazis . if you were called racist in that time the accusation had a stronger impact largely related to interest convergence . if you are condemning those kind of atrocities then your own racist behavior will be under the microscope as we ’ll . nowadays it seems like the default for accusations of racism is to assume that it is erroneous . this actually goes well beyond ” cry wolf ” scenarios . if a person does say/do something racist they can neutralize the accusation by playing up the false accusation narrative . an accusation of racism does essentially nothing to the accused . it likely wo n't be understood as legitimate . it likely wo n't be understood as a moment of self-reflection by the accused . and very rarely will it have any social consequences . there are certainly cases where people lose there job due to racist statements but even the blatant examples are often rationalized as simply not the person intention . rarely is it understood as a personality flaw that should be corrected . due to the very active opposition against anti-racists , calling someone racist more often makes the accuser seem irrational and rarely exposes the irrationality of someone ’s racism . in this sense it ’s impact has been neutralized ."

 it is ok to say generalized statements about white people but not racial minorities .,however if an racial minority committed a despicable act it would not be ok to say are people of that ethnic group are despicable . the reasons being 1 . white supremacy and alternative similar thought lines are much more wide ranging ( slavery in america for hundreds of years ) than any quote “ reverse racism . ” white people are not oppressed . and 2 . all white people should be held accountable for the actions of any white person because many times in history white people who benefited from their privilege where complacent by not acting or speaking out against atrocities committed by other white individuals . i now view my original thought as problematic . essentially because when people say “ all while people ” they do n’t mean it and it might discourage people who might otherwise support my cause .

Counter-1:,"this point you're making is'why do you think women are raped if you'd like to do x with them?'i'm not sure what you're trying to get at here. are you saying people shouldn't think rape is a'bad idea '? because that's the most basic and fundamental reason a person should wear a hijab, and unless you don't believe in the concept of a'good idea ', you shouldn't think women are sexually harassed. rape is, in general, about power, sexual harassment, by the very definition of harassment."

Counter-1:,"in that case, you also need to support the argument that the legal drinking age for 18 should be 25 25 24 in the new age. i agree with you here, but there's no way for this to be true. you're probably going to be responsible for your own future. you're an adult. it doesn't really matter if you have a drinking age or not. so that's no big deal, and it's not going to happen to you."

Counter-1:,"it's not even a legal standpoint. it has the rights to be posted on every internet page. if i don't agree with your sentiment about copyright, then my argument falls apart. if someone has signed a contract stating they would not do so in a way that would be deemed unethical, and it makes no difference if they were not coerced or not, it is in their best interest to uphold the contract. the only reason it would not be a good thing is because it would be illegal."

  pedophiles should be offered help rather than being hated for existing .,"raping children and child porn are obviously evil things . however , we as a society need to do better and how we look at pedophiles to help decrease these things . pedophiles do n't choose to be attracted to children . it 's not their fault . i 'm not saying it 's their fault when they rape kids , that clearly is there fault as it is an external action , but they do not intentionally find children attractive . even religious groups against homosexuality almost always agree that being gay is not a choice , and therefore not a sin . ( i do n't believe that , i fully support gay people ) . where they have problem is the action of dating , marrying or having sex with someone of the same gender . this same mentality should be applied by all towards pedophiles this would make the pedophiles that struggle in resisting their urges because they know it 's wrong be more willing to talk to close friends about it , and more importantly , to therapists . i think there would be a lot less child sexual abuse if they had a therapist to talk to and get help from ."
Counter-1:,yes it is! and a lot of them do it because they believe they are better than the person they rape. that's why they are violent! pedophiles do not choose to be sexually attracted to young girls. they don't choose to use rape as a motivator. pedophiles choose to be abusive molesters.

  safe space subreddits do more harm than good .,"missinformation and echo chambers can cause harm , primarily through causing people to vote and see the world in a way that is not supported by facts and bringing in candidates who platform on falsehoods . furthermore missinformation and fake news can cause real harm in some extreme cases such as the debunked pizza gate incident where a man shot up a popular pizza restaurant under the false belief that he was saving children trapped in a sex slave ring . obviously subreddits should have moderation , but i personally feel this should be limited to removing obvious troll and unconstructive posts . in some political subreddits , stating factual information which happens to highlight flaws in ideology or simply fails to "" tow the party line "" within the subreddit can warrant a ban because the subreddit is meant to be a "" safe space "" and contradictory information is unwelcome . by banning users who attempt to correct or debunk falsehoods which further the subreddits agenda , the subreddit gives a platform for fake news and missinformation to spread and cause harm . furthermore , i am of the opinion , that if you are secure in your beliefs , then surely you should be secure enough in them to defend your worldview from opposing viewpoints . ( hopefully this does n't come back to bite me in an ironic way . ) banning / silencing people presenting reasonably backed up contributions which challenge your viewpoint is something that should be relegated to an orwellian dystopia , not a platform for free speech and open sharing of information such as reddit ."
Counter-1:,"if the platform is free speech it can create or prevent harm. you can't deny that. however, if it is true that there are false interpretations and misrepresentations, then that will be a platform for dishonest people to spread false information. people who commit crime sometimes don't care and are afraid to do so. and some people who commit fraud are often in danger of being jailed."

Counter-1:,"so the two sides have completely dehumanized the other. who's to say that trump will stop doing that? he may start his cult, but how is that fair? what's his new cult, if not a cult? i'm not sure what you expect him to do."

  feminism is not based in gender empowerment feminism is based in woman empowerment and not specific in gender empowerment .,"for example : men are : 97 % of death in combat 74 % of death by murder 93 % of death by work 80 % of suicides and other major problems exist , domestic violence for example . in much countries there is already same laws to every gender . one more point - mainly feminism is more linked to activism , im not machist or against equality just becuase i am not feminismo , actually that 's a fallacy . so yes i can be in favor of equality without being actually feminist , i can be supporter of new ideias for feminism for example . the problem with feminism - its a movement with distinct phases that fight in different moments for different goals that have the final goal of equallity and that not always mean equallity . so yes im in favor of gender equallity , anyways i prefer saying that i support equallity for all human beings , there is much importance in gender when shouldnt be , to be honest , gender is unnecessary when we can be identified by our sex . so in this final part i added a few more ideas that were not supposed . anyways my grammar is not the best , this is not my first language . now be free to change my mind ."
Counter-1:,"but let's let's get the point across. a certain group of people, if they are more intelligent, can probably be considered a'feminist'in feminist circles because they view gender as a role they play. if they had become feminist it wouldn't be the case that there would be so many people who view women as less'feminist'and they would view women as less'feminist'in feminism because of their gender. and it wouldn't have any implications in feminism at all that women should not be considered as'worse'for men than men, only that people would consider them less'feminist '. the idea that we are all inherently inferior to men is a bad idea."

"  bullying is necessary , if not required for a functional society .","also in bullying , the whole concept is done to force a change onto either a person or an idea ( of any size ) . for instance someone might bully someone else because of their clothing or sexual orientation ( small things ) . or someone could bully a group of people because of their ideology or way of life ( religion , cultural customs ) ( large things ) . now , in light of this , sometimes people need to change , whether they believe so or not , because they might not know that what they are doing could be destructive towards them or their environment . for example : if some dude walks into your school or workplace wearing super tight pants , where you can see everything very clearly , by all means should he be bullied about it so that no one else is adversely affected by his decision . also : ( on a larger scale ) if a political leader denies climate change referendum , bullying should be required , but at that level the naming would change to ' protesting ' instead of bullying . now , i 'm not saying the way bullying takes place is a good thing or needed , for a lot of it escalates quickly to harassment and violence , i just think the concept of forcing change is needed . so , change my view ."
Counter-1:,"bullying is done to bully and oppress people who oppose it. it can also be a lot of different things. maybe a small piece of the problem comes from the lack of control, or the fact that some groups hate the other extremists. you could also apply this to bullying which can potentially be used to create a platform where bullies are forced to express themselves. the thing is, bullying is actually an opportunity for everyone to change."

 there are infinite genders .,"gender is the state of how you feel , or if you want to use "" the word "" , what you identify as . sex is the biological difference between people with xx and xy chromosomes . now , i think that the idea of infinite sexes is ridiculous . but the idea that there are infinite things that people can ( i 'm using "" the word "" again ) identify as is n't . people can feel however they want to , and they will not always align with their current bodies . if someone genuinely feels like they 're not male or female internally , then i see no reason why we should tell them otherwise . cmv my v has been c 'd . thanks to everyone who participated !"
Counter-1:,"there isn't any connection between this and the idea that there are infinite things that can be categorized into biological differences. the way i see it, there are people who identify as male or female internally. there is one sex that is both male and female, so there is one gender that identifies as both. and the other sex is called,'the penis.'the people who identify as both are both male and female on average, while the person who identifies as both has a penis."
Counter-2:,"i do n't think it 's accurate to say that gender is a binary , but rather a sex drive , which is a biological feature of the word "" sex "" . it 's not a binary concept , it 's just a matter of perspective . there 's no such thing as "" gender roles "" . there are a lot of different definitions of what you 're talking about here . there is no difference between "" gender "" and "" female "" and """

  meaningful forgiveness can only be given upon request .,"that does n't seem right or useful to me . in such situations the wronged party essentially excuses their offender 's behavior even when it does n't necessarily deserve to be , and perpetuates that behavior . a good example might be a case where a person is raped is decides to forgive their attacker instead of seeking justice ; the rapist is free to continue their attacks with their actions uncontested and without remorse . so in practice it seems that forgiveness given without repentance effectively condones acts which can be unacceptably immoral . i 'm no psychologist but it further seems like doing so may risk the victim 's feeling of self worth deteriorating . is repentance necessary for true forgiveness to be given ?"
Counter-1:,"if the'i'was doing this'doesn't actually exist, it's very likely immoral to do so anyway. however, since you can't prove it, how can you conclude it must not have been right for you? can you justify that behavior without that person's participation? would a hypothetical rapist be better off without forgiveness? in other words, how can we conclude the'your punishment is not moral '?"
Counter-2:,"the problem with this is that it assumes that punishment is bad because it allows for the greater good of a society to be able to prevent crime . if you do n't want to be punished , then you have to accept the consequences of your actions . you do not have the right to defend yourself from your own actions , but you can not be punished for doing so . you can choose not to have a gun , but if you have a right to do that , you should be allowed to do so ."
