i do n't think it 's fair to say that you do n't want to live in a civilized society , but i think you 're missing the point of the discussion . i think it is important to remember that we are all human beings , and that is what we have now . it 's not that we do n't live in an ideal world , it 's that we live in the same situation as everyone else . we are not a threat to our ancestors . we do not live in a
there 's a lot of talk about this , but it 's not a huge stretch of the imagination . it 's a very small piece of the puzzle . he 's not going to be able to do anything about it , but he does n't have to worry about the consequences of his campaign promises . he is n't going to do that , and he 's going to have to do something about it . i think it 's pretty easy to say that it 's just as easy to think of him as a politician .
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that we should n't have to worry about the consequences of our actions , but rather that we do n't want to do something about it . i think we should do it , but it 's not the only thing we can do . we 're not going to be able to do anything about it , we just do n't know what it 's like to do . you do n't need to know what 's going on in the world , and what you 're doing is
the people who do n't want to pay for the least amount of funding are the ones who are n't paying attention to it . they are n't going to do anything about it , they just want to do it . it 's not like they do n't care about politics . they 're not going to be able to do that . if you do n't like it , you should n't be allowed to complain about it . you should be proud of what you 're doing . you can choose not to vote for you ,
i think it 's fair to say that the state should have a right to do whatever they want with their own bodies , but i do n't think it should be illegal to do so in a way that does n't infringe on the rights of others in the first place . i think that 's a very slippery slope . it 's just a matter of perspective . i do not think it is fair to deny someone 's right to bodily autonomy if they do n't want to . it is a slippery slope to me .
i do n't think you can argue that this is a " right " , but i think it 's important to note that the vast majority of us do n't want to be drafted . it 's not just a matter of time , it 's a problem . if you do n't have a child , you should n't have to worry about being drafted . you 're going to end up with a lot of problems , and you ca n't afford to pay for it if you 're a woman . it 's
there is no such thing as a " UNK " campaign . if you want to get rid of it , you need to be able to make the best possible candidates . it 's not just a matter of opinion , it 's a symptom of a wide variety of candidates . the problem is that the candidates are n't always going to be swayed by the candidates . if they do n't , then it 's the lesser of two evils . it 's
it 's also important to note that many of these groups are often accused of being in a position of power . they are n't just a bunch of idiots , they 're just a subset of the population . they 're not the only ones who are n't the ones who want to protect the interests of the government . they do n't want to be in the business of defending themselves . they are
the only way to do this would be to remove the power of the air force . it would have to be done . the problem is that it 's not the only one . there is no such thing as a terrorist attack . it 's just a matter of perspective . if you want to get rid of it , you need to look at the history of the us . it is not a perfect solution , but it is the most effective way to achieve it . it 's
i do n't think it 's fair to say that they should n't be allowed to complain about politics . it 's not that they are lying about politics , it 's that they do n't want to do anything about it . they are n't going to be able to change their views , but they do . if they do , they should be able to
the issue is that this is not the case . there is no such thing as a " free speech " . it is not a political issue , it is a violation of the first amendment . the right to bear arms is the right of the people to participate in the affairs of others . if you want to argue that it is a
the best way to do this is to get rid of the electoral college . if you want to do that , you need to be able to pass laws that do n't have to be enacted . you have to have a majority opinion of all citizens . you ca n't have a representative democracy . it 's not a democracy . the senate is n't supposed to be representative of the population . it is a collection of states that are not represented by the majority of voters . it is
i think you are wrong about the fact that there are millions of people who are willing to work for the betterment of the world , and that they deserve the opportunity to do so in order to save the lives of others , which is why they are not in the best interests of the united states . they are the only ones who deserve to be treated equally . the only way to do that is to stop them from doing so . if they do n't want to do it , then they should be able to
there are a lot of vegans in the west who do n't want to spend billions of dollars on charity to feed their family and raise their children and raise them in the first place , but i do n't think it 's fair to compare them to donating blood to coal miners , or at least to the extent that they are breeding in their home countries . it 's not hypocritical to say that it 's hypocritical to not have children , but it 's certainly not hypocritical . i think that 's a different discussion . i
i do n't think it 's fair to say that the police should be allowed to do whatever they want , but if you do n't want to be a police officer , you 're going to have a hard time finding people who do n't have guns , and you 're not going to be able to defend yourself at all , and if you 're in a situation where there is no such thing as a threat , then you have to worry about the consequences of your actions . if you are a cop , and you
i think it 's important to note that this is not the only way to get rid of it . it 's not a perfect solution , but it does n't make any sense . if you 're going to have to worry about whether or not it 's a good idea , it 's going to be pretty hard to convince you to do it . i do n't think it is fair to say that it 's the best way to do that . i think that 's a pretty good indication . i 'm going to assume
the electoral college is supposed to be a balance between the interests of the nation and the populace . this is why we have a representative democracy . it is a system of checks and balances . the electoral system is meant to ensure that the population is not represented by the population . it 's not a democracy , it 's a representative republic . if you do n't want to participate in the political process , you have to have a voice . if you
there is no such thing as a right to bodily autonomy , and the right to life supersedes the right of the mother to keep and bear arms , and thus the rights of the woman to terminate the life of the fetus . this is not the same thing as incest . it is the same reason why we have laws against incest . the laws of the land are not based on morality , but rather the means of production . we can not determine whether or not it is moral or not . we should be able
i think you are underestimating the divide between the two parties . it 's not that simple . i think it 's important to remember that there are very few places in the us where there is a lot of illegal immigrants in the united states . i do n't think that 's a fair comparison . i 'm pretty sure there are a lot in the middle east , but it 's also not very easy to do so . it 's
it 's like saying that she should n't be allowed to do anything she wants to do because she does n't want to . it 's not like she 's a woman . she 's not going to be able to talk about it . she is n't going to get a lot of flak , but she 's still going to have to worry about being raped . if she does n't
i think you 're misunderstanding the purpose of the second amendment . it 's not that simple , it 's just that it 's the only way to protect yourself from a tyrannical government . if you do n't want to be able to defend yourself , you have to have a right to bear arms . you have no right to own a gun , but you have to
if you 're talking about a specific subset of black people in the us , then i think you 're wrong about the fact that a lot of white people are in a position of disadvantage , and that the government should not be allowed to discriminate based on race , gender , class , etc . it 's not a question of whether or not it 's ok to force someone to do something they do n't want to do , but rather to force them to do so . if you do n't like it , then you
the victim is not a victim of a crime . it is a person . the victim does not have the right to decide whether or not they want to . if they do n't want to do that , they should n't be able to do it again . if you do n't have a car , you have to go to court . you can choose to not have a trial , but you ca n't do that . you ca nâ€™t have to deal with the consequences of your actions . it is
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that the us is the only superpower in the history of the us . it 's not . the us has a long history of doing this . i think it is important to remember that there is no such thing as a " UNK " or a " fascist " state . there are very few things that are n't the result of this . there is a lot of room for interpretation , but there are many other countries that do n't want to be in power .
the reason why we do n't want to be a victim of a crime is because we have a lot of human rights abuses , and we have to deal with the fact that we are all human beings , and that we should be able to control what we can and can not do with our lives . i do n't think it 's fair to say we should n't do it , but i do think we should try to mitigate the consequences of our actions . if you do n't have the opportunity to do anything ,
i do n't think it 's fair to say that gays should n't be allowed to marry , but that 's not the same thing as discriminating against homosexuals . it 's not a right to discriminate based on gender . it 's
the problem is that black people do n't need to worry about being black . it 's not that hard to change your view . it does n't matter if you 're talking about racism or sexism . it just is n't the case . racism is n't just about skin color , it 's about being proud of something . if you do n't want to be associated with it , then you should n't have to worry that it 's okay to do so . you can be proud of your skin color . if you
if you 're talking about voting , then you should n't be able to vote . it 's not the voting system , it 's the electoral college . if you do n't want to vote , you 're not going to win . you 're voting for the lesser of two evils . you have to be represented by the population . you can choose to vote for whichever candidate you want to win , but if you want the candidates to be more popular , you can get a better candidate . if you
there is a lot of room for this kind of thing . i do n't think it 's fair to say that we should n't have to deal with the consequences of having a child , but i do think it should be mandatory . i think it is important to remember that children are not capable of making their own decisions . children do n't have the right to vote because they do n't want to have children . it 's not a matter of rights , it 's a system that does n't have a right to exist
if you want to point out that there is no such thing as " objectivity " or " UNK " in the past , it 's not a stretch to say that the term " negro " is a euphemism for the " alt-right " , which is that it 's a term used to refer to the " red herring " as " the left " and " white " . it 's the exact opposite of what you 're saying , and i think it 's important to remember that there are a lot of different kinds of
the right to peaceably assemble is a right that everyone has to follow , and the right of the citizens to decide what happens to their own bodies . this is why we have a right to free speech . it is not an expression of free speech , it is an expression of
this is a very slippery slope , and it is not a perfect solution . it is a slippery slope . if you want to argue that this is the case , then it is the most effective way to do this . i think it 's important to keep in mind that we are talking about a situation where there is no way to prove guilt . if we 're going to assume that we do n't know what it 's like to be a terrorist , what 's to stop it from happening ? i do n't think
i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's not a crime against incest or incest . it 's also not the same as being attracted to the same sex . if you want to argue that marriage is a spectrum , then it 's a slippery slope . i think you 're making a false dichotomy here . it 's
i do n't think it 's possible to argue that life begins at conception , but i think it is important to distinguish between life and reproduction . it 's not like that 's what you 're describing . it is not a religious belief , it 's a matter of opinion . it does n't make sense to me . i think you should be able to change your view . i do not think it should be used as a justification for it . it is
i think you 're making a mistake in assuming that humans are capable of killing each other , and that there is no such thing as a " natural " or a " normal " life . i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's not a problem , but it 's certainly not the case . it 's a very small , messy , UNK , and expensive process . i think it is important to recognize that it is n't always possible to be a victim of a crime , but i do n't
i do n't think it 's unreasonable to say that it should be a requirement for all citizens to be able to own a gun . i think it is important to note that this is not the case . it 's not that we do n't want to go to war , it 's just that we should n't have to worry about the consequences of our actions . we should be armed with a gun , and we should do that . i do think we should have the right to bear arms , but i do n't
the rust belt is a UNK example of this . it 's not like it 's just a matter of policy , it 's that it 's a very small percentage of the population . so it 's more accurate to say that it is n't a factor in the electoral college itself . the problem is that there is no way to change it . it just means that there are only two parties in the first place . it is not the democrats fault , it is the people who voted for it . the republicans are the
i do n't think it 's fair to say that we should n't have a right to defend ourselves if we do n't want to . i think that 's what we are taught to do . i do not think it is right to force me to give up my right to bodily autonomy . it is a right that i can not do with my own body . i am not responsible for my own actions , but i am also responsible for the actions of others . if i have a choice , i am responsible for
the us has a lot of power in the us , but it 's not the only way to do it . it 's also not so much that it 's the best course of action . it is also not the best way to ensure that the us is a bastion of democracy . i think it 's fair to say that we should n't have to worry about the consequences of our actions , but i do n't think we should be able to do that . if we do n't want to , we should do it
i think you are underestimating the usefulness of the right to vote . i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's okay to vote for someone who does n't agree with you . it 's not a right that you do n't want to do . i think it is a fair criticism of the democratic party . if you want to be a republican , you need to be able to express yourself . you can be a member of that group , but it 's also not the same as being a democrat .
the reason we do n't want to live in a western society is because we are afraid of the state of affairs in the past , which is why we have a rule of thumb where we have the ability to act in the best interest of our own interests . we do not want to have a say in what happens to our society . we are supposed to be the best we can , and we can not do that . we have to be able to decide what is best for us . if we do n't
i think it 's important to note that the vast majority of people who are in favor of having children do n't want to have children , they do n't care about being a victim of a crime , they are just as likely to have a child as a member of the community as a result of their life experiences . it 's not as simple as that . i do n't think it is fair to say that this is the case . but i think that it is a violation of the first amendment . it is
it 's also important to note that many of the founding fathers wanted to secede from the british empire . they were n't even UNK , they were not allowed to do so . they did n't want to go to war , but they did n't
i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's okay to discriminate based on gender . it 's just a matter of perspective . if you 're talking about gender roles , you should n't be able to talk about gender as a social construct . i think that 's what you 're saying here . i do not think it is fair to assume that gender is a binary , but that it is a biological fact . it is not a binary choice . gender is not the same as being a woman . it
this is a great example of how hard it is to invest in low income housing . it 's not like it 's going to end up being worse for everyone . if you do n't like it , you 're going to have to worry about it . the rich do n't want to pay for it because they do n't have to pay taxes . they are n't going to be able to do anything about it , they just do n't want
there are a lot of studies that show that women are more likely to be poor than men , and that they are more concerned with the life of a child than a female born woman . this is not the case . it is not a matter of opinion , but rather a symptom of a lack of understanding of the world . so , i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's not a feminist issue , but i think it is important to acknowledge that there is a difference between feminism and the
the only way to get rid of the electoral college is to make sure that the citizens are not represented by the government . this is not the case . it is not a democracy , it is a system of checks and balances . there is no such thing as a " tyranny " or a " democracy . " it is the right of the people to decide what is best for the country . if you do n't want to be part of the democratic party , you have to be able to vote for you .
i think it 's important to distinguish between the two groups and the trump administration . they are both equally racist and sexist . they 're both equally partisan and fair . i think that 's a stretch to say that trump is a racist . i do n't think he 's going to be able to do anything about it , but i think he is more likely to be in a position of power than he is . it 's not that he 's racist , it 's just that he does n't want to be associated with
the green party in the last election won the popular vote . the result was the same . the two parties did n't have the power to do anything about it . they did n't want to vote for them because they were n't going to win . it 's not like they do n't care about politics , it 's just that they are n't voting for the lesser of two evils . they 're not going to be able to change their views , but they do . if they do n't
the problem with this is that it assumes that the two parties are identical to each other . the problem is that there is no such thing as a " right " or " right . " it is not a right that everyone is entitled to , but it is a right . the right to vote is the right of the people to decide what is best for the country . it is the same as a right to self-determination . if you want to have a say in what happens to you , you should be able
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that you do n't have to worry about the consequences of your actions , but i do think that it 's important to have a conversation with someone who does n't agree with you . it 's not like you 're trying to make a difference . i think you 're missing the point of the discussion . if you want to talk about it , you 're going to have to take a lot of effort to change your view . if you
if you want to change your view , then you have to ask yourself : why do you think that it 's okay to have a discussion about how a society should have a say in what life is like , and what is a good thing for a society , and that we should be able to control what we can and can not do as a society to a degree that we do n't need to worry about the consequences of our actions as a result of our own actions , and if we 're going to change
i think it 's important to remember that a lot of what you 're talking about is n't really a thing . it 's a feature of human nature . it does n't matter if it 's the best , it 's just a matter of perspective . if you do n't like it , you 're not going to be able to do anything about it . you 're going to have to do something about it , but it 's not always a bad thing . you ca n't do it yourself , and you can not do
the reason why we need to do so is to ensure that the people who are in the military are in control of the military , and that the us should be able to provide a deterrent for those who do not want to be part of the us military , which is to say that it is not possible to be a citizen of the united states , and it is a violation of our right to free speech . it is also important to note that this is not the case . i do n't think it 's
i agree with you , but i think it 's important to note that i do n't think we should all be able to agree on what is best for the environment . i think that it is fair to say that we should not be striving for the actions of the wealthy , but that is not the case . it is not a zero-sum game , it is just a symptom of a lack of opportunity . it 's not fair to assume that the wealthy elite are smarter than the rich , but rather that they are
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that this is n't the case , but it 's not the same as reddit . it 's just a matter of opinion . if you 're going to use reddit as an example , then you have to look at the actual data . if i 'm going to respond to this post , i 'd like to ask you to clarify what you mean by " objective " . what you 're saying is that it 's impossible to have a consistent view on what is and is
we do n't need to worry about the consequences of our policies , we need to be able to do so . if we want to do that , we should do it . we need more transparency . but we do n't
if you look at the history of the kkk , it 's pretty clear that there is a difference between the UNK and the jews . it 's not the same as any other ethnic groups , but it 's the opposite of what you 're describing . the kkk is a christian nation , and it 's a group of people who share the same values . it is not a religion , it is a collection of ideologies . it is
if you look at the UNK of the UNK , you 'll see that the rise of dictators in the united states is very similar to the rise in the us . it 's not a stretch to say that there is no such thing as a " peaceful " or " UNK " or anything like that . there are also plenty of examples of countries that are in the middle east , but that 's not the case . there 's no reason to believe that it 's a bad thing . it 's
the problem is that it 's not just a matter of opinion , it 's the fact that it is a requirement . it 's a feature of the founding fathers . it is not a democracy . it has to do with the electoral college . if you do n't want to vote , you have to have a voice . if you
this is a very broad statement , but i think it 's important to distinguish between the two groups . one of the most important things to consider is whether or not it 's possible to have a consistent set of rules . if you want to talk about the merits of political parties , you need to look at the different sides of the political spectrum . you 're right that there is a lot of overlap between the left and the right . however , there are a lot more of them than there are . there are
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that it 's not a political ideology . it 's just that there are plenty of examples of what you 're talking about . there are a lot of different kinds of disagreement , but it 's important to note that there is no such thing as a " fascist " or a " UNK " . it does n't have to be that way , it 's that there is
the reason why we do n't have laws in the first place is because we have a lot of gun control laws , and we have to be able to do so in order to protect the rights of the citizens of the country . it 's not a good idea to have a say in the matter . it is a matter of practicality . if you do n't want to be punished , you have to go to jail for it . if you
i think it 's important to distinguish between the two groups , and it 's not fair to label them as a monolithic entity . it 's a feature of our society , not a group of people . we 're all privileged , and we 're not all equal . we are a collection of individuals . we 're
it was n't until the end of the 19th century . the confederacy was n't the only one who won the war . it was a series of dictators that had been involved in the confederacy . the only way to do that would be to remove the power of the south . it would have been better for the west to succeed . it 's not like it was the south 's fault , it was because of the history of the united states . it is not the fault of the white nationalists , it is the fact
there is no such thing as a separation of church and state , and there is a lot of room for cases where the mother 's life is in danger , but it 's not the only thing that matters , and it 's also important to note that it 's important to remember that children are n't the only ones who can get custody of the child . they 're not going to be able to do that . it 's just a matter of perspective . if you do n't want to be a member of society ,
the problem is that there are a lot of jobs that are available to them . if you do n't want to pay for it , you are going to end up with a lot more poverty than you do now . so , if you are earning more than you are now , then you have to pay more . you are n't going to be able to do anything other than the rest of your life . you do not have to worry about being able to get a job , but you are not going to be
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that the united states is a superpower . it 's just that it 's not . the us is not a homogenous nation . it is a collection of countries . it is
the russians ali
i think it 's important to distinguish between the two scenarios , and i think that it 's more important to understand what you mean by " different " . i think you 're correct , but i think it
if you 're talking about the us , i think you 're more likely to have a gun . i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that it 's not a good idea to own guns , but i think that 's a very different thing . i think it is important to note that there are a lot of guns in the us . it 's very difficult to defend yourself . if you want to be a gun owner , you need to be armed . if you
it 's not that we do n't live in a democracy , it 's that we have a right to self-determination . it 's a violation of our right to free speech . the right to own slaves is a right that we can not control . it is not slavery , it is the right of the state to keep and bear arms . if you want to be a slave , you should be able to control what you do with your own country . you can choose to do it , but you ca n't do it
the right to vote is the right of the united states to participate in the affairs of others . it is not a right that you are entitled to . the right is a right to be free to choose what you want , but you can not compel you to do it . it 's not right to say whatever you want to do . if you do n't like it , you should n't be allowed to complain about it . you should be able to express yourself to your own beliefs . you can be fired for
there is no such thing as a " feminist " movement . it 's not just a matter of what it is , it 's a group of people who are in favor of it . women are not the only ones who are oppressed . women have been subject to the same rules as men . women are
if you believe in the right to free speech , then it is not a right . if you do n't agree with what you say , then you have to accept that it is a slippery slope . it 's not that you are n't allowed to say whatever you want , it 's that you do not have the right , and that you should not be allowed to speak freely . you can not have a right to express your views , but that does n't mean you should n't do it . if you
i think it 's important to note that the vast majority of cases are not prosecuted . it 's very difficult to prove that someone should be allowed to own a gun . if you do n't want to have a gun , you should n't be able to defend yourself . you ca n't do it without having to worry about the consequences of your actions . you can choose to not have a dui , but if you 're not allowed to drive , then you should be held responsible for the consequences . you should not be
there is no doubt that the life of an unborn child is not a violation of the rights of the mother , but the right to life , and the right of the child to be born into a class of parents , and to the point where it is possible to have an abortion . this is not the same as the conception of the pro-life movement . it is not an issue of morality , it is a matter of personal preference . the only difference is that there is a difference between the two . it is
i do n't think it 's fair to say that life begins at conception , but i think it is worth pointing out that a lot of the time it 's a case of " personhood " and " life " in terms of how the fetus is dependent on the mother . it 's not just a matter of practicality , it 's an opinion of the nervous system . if you do n't want to have a say , you should n't have to do that . i think you should be able to argue that it is
if you 're talking about the us , it 's very easy to say that it 's not a violation of the 14th amendment , but it 's also important to note that the us is not the same as the us . there are many other countries that do n't want to be in the usa . i do n't think it 's fair to say it 's a good thing , but i think it would be a good idea to assume that it is . it 's not
i think it 's important to distinguish between the two , and i think that it 's possible to have a conversation with someone who does n't want to be in a situation where they are n't mature enough to be able to relate to the consequences of their actions . i do n't think that 's the case . if you 're going to argue that you should n't be allowed to have sex with you , you should be punished for it . i think you 're right , but i think it
i do n't think it 's a bad idea to say that it 's okay to murder someone because they do n't want to be murdered . i think that 's a pretty reasonable thing to do . if you want to live in a country where you do n't have the right to marry you , then you have a right to defend yourself and your family . it 's not a right that you have to follow . it is a right that
there is no such thing as " biological sex " in the sense that a person can be born with a biological sex , and if you do n't want to have a sense of gender , then you have to accept that there is a difference between the sexes and the idea of having sex with someone who does n't conform to their gender . if you 're saying that it 's okay to discriminate based on genitalia , then it does n't make sense to assume that it is . it 's just a matter of perspective .
the problem is that you do n't have to worry about the consequences of your actions . if you do not want to participate in the system , you should n't be able to vote . you can vote for a candidate you want , but if you are n't going to vote , you 're not going to get reelected . it 's just a matter of voter apathy . the voting system is designed to disenfranchise the voters . it does n't matter if it 's voting , it 's the voting booth . it 's
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that muslims should be allowed to speak for themselves . it 's not that they are muslim , it 's just that they do n't want to participate in it . i think that 's a valid reason to ban it . if you do n't like it , then you should n't have to worry about it . you 're not going to be able to change your view , but you should be willing to admit that it 's okay to do so . it 's
the problem is that the courts are not always going to be able to do that . it 's not like they 're going to do anything about it . they do n't want to be in prison . they are supposed to be the ones who are going to get out of jail . if they 're not going to commit a crime , they 'll be punished . if you do n't have the opportunity to do so , you 're screwed . if you
i think it 's important to distinguish between " racism " and " privilege " . it 's not about racism , it 's about racism . racism is a way of saying " i do n't think you 're racist . " it 's just a matter of perspective . if you 're talking about averages , then you 're going to end up with a lot of racism and sexism . but that does n't mean it 's a privilege , it just means that it 's more accurate to say " white privilege . " i think
i think it 's important to note that the majority of the population is not vaccinated . it 's not illegal to sell alcohol to anyone . it is illegal to smoke . tobacco is illegal because it 's illegal . if you do n't want to pay for it , you should n't be allowed to sell it . you ca n't force someone to carry a gun to your head . if they do n't have access to alcohol , they should n't have the right to do whatever they want . it 's
it 's not that we 're talking about " privilege " , it 's just that it 's a very small percentage of the worlds wealth . it 's true , but it 's still true . if you look at the history of racism , sexism , racism , and sexism , you 're going to end up with a lot of different problems . the problem is that there is no such thing as " white privilege " . there are many examples of systemic racism in the united states . white privilege does n't exist . it
the issue is that it 's not a violation of the 1st amendment . it 's a requirement for the government to be involved in enforcing it . if you do n't want to be arrested , then you should n't be allowed to do it . it is not a crime , it is a violation . it is
it 's not about funding students , it 's about teaching students to schools . it 's a way to educate students who do n't want to teach students to learn . students should n't be allowed to attend school because students are n't allowed to teach their students to do so . students are not students . students who are students should not be subject to the same educational background as students . schools should be taught in schools . students should
i do n't think it 's fair to say that we should n't have to worry about the consequences of our actions . i think we should consider the consequences and consequences of the actions of those involved . if you do n't want to have a child , then you should n't be able to do that . you should be responsible for your actions . you are not responsible for the consequences . it is a matter of weighing the costs of your actions , not the consequences , and the consequences for the actions . if you
i do n't disagree with you , but i think it 's fair to say that the us is a republic . it 's not a democracy , it 's a representative republic . the founding fathers did n't have the power to decide what was best for the country . it was a compromise between the states and the government . it was
i do n't think it 's fair to say that it 's okay to have a child , but i think it is important to note that this is not the case . it 's not a matter of personal preference , it 's a lack of understanding of the consequences of their actions . if you do n't want to be a doctor , then you should n't be allowed to have sex with you . you should be able to choose not to abort . you can choose to not have an abortion , but you should n't
i do n't think anyone should be allowed to have a say in how they want to express their views . if you want to be a member of the government , you need to be able to speak freely about it . it 's not a matter of opinion , it 's about what you 're doing . if someone does n't want to censor you , you should n't have to censor them . if they do n't like it , they should n't be allowed . it 's
it 's not a stretch to say that the nazi party is the cause of the collapse of the free world , it 's that it 's the only thing that matters in the first place . it 's just a matter of perspective . if you want to argue that it is , you should be able to change your view . i do n't think it 's fair to say it 's a bad idea , but i think it should be reformed . i think that 's a good way to look at it . it 's
i do n't think it 's fair to say that feminism is a monolithic entity . it 's not a feminist issue , it 's just a matter of perspective . feminism is n't about equality , it is about egalitarianism . it 's
if you do n't want to be a member of the society , you should be able to do whatever you want with it . if you want to do that , then you have to do it . you can not do anything with your own body , and you ca n't do that . it 's just a matter of perspective . it is n't just about what you think is right or wrong , it 's about what is right and what is not . if you
i do n't think it 's a stretch to say that we should n't be proud of our accomplishments , but i think we should be able to do that . if you are a member of the eu , you should be proud to be an american citizen . you can not be proud of
i do n't think it 's accurate to say that gender is a binary , but rather a sex drive , which is a biological feature of the word " sex " . it 's not a binary concept , it 's just a matter of perspective . there 's no such thing as " gender roles " . there are a lot of different definitions of what you 're talking about here . there is no difference between " gender " and " female " and "
the problem with this is that it assumes that punishment is bad because it allows for the greater good of a society to be able to prevent crime . if you do n't want to be punished , then you have to accept the consequences of your actions . you do not have the right to defend yourself from your own actions , but you can not be punished for doing so . you can choose not to have a gun , but if you have a right to do that , you should be allowed to do so .
