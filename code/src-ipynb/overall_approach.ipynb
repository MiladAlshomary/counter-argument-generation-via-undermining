       "9lxv8u       [1 ., i do n't agree with the notion of not being ' responsible ' or ' educated ' enough to make a political decision ., for a start , many young people below the voting age are incredibly well versed in politics and national affairs ., some more so than many adults ., should adults with mental handicaps be allowed to vote ?, yes obviously ., and even if their decision is one of pure emotion and brashness with no political or socio-economic knowledge , there 's nothing wrong with that , to vote purely of ideals and passion is a perfectly normal thing to do ., the point of a democracy is that there is no objectively right or wrong parties to vote for ., 2 ., it 's discrimination , no other way to put it ., replace \" we cant give young people the vote because they wont use it correctly \" with \" we cant give female/black/homosexual / old people the vote because they wont use it correctly \" and this becomes much more obvious ., the ability to directly influence the way your country is run is a human right , and human rights are not distributed based on bars to entry ., you may say that age is different , and yes , when it comes to drugs/gambling/working / ect this is true ., but that is because these are things where a child is at risk of harm or being exploited themselves directly , they are not on a comparable level to voting where at worst a child is misinformed by a political party ... because that never happens to adults [ -- url -- ) ., 3 ., if the child is too young to post their ballot directly , then the vote is given to the child 's guardian ., obviously there is no way a four month old baby can voice their intent , which is why their vote should go to the person/people who have their best interest at heart ; their parents ., a baby still needs to eat food and have clean clothes , it is still a member of the society it is growing up in , and will one day have to study and work in said society ., ( in the rare cases where the child has no legal guardian or the parents have conflicting choices then the vote would be unable to be made , this is not ideal but there are not really any ways round this ) i have held this opinion all my life , i am now old enough to vote and am an active voter but still feel that many of the people younger than me are not having their voices heard ., i have had this view challenged quite a few time but so far no one has given me a convincing enough argument , i hope that if my idea is naive that you might reveal that to me ., thanks \\ - for a bit of context into my experience with this ; my friends and i were all few months off turning 18 when the uk brexit referendum happened ., myself and most of my peers felt incredibly powerless from our lack of ability to influence the outcome directly and the fact that the final decision was within a such a small margin that young people could have genuinely swung the tides left a very sour taste in our mouths .]   \n",
