', i would lastly like to clarify that this is not a soapbox speech, this is not a crusade for my view, i simply just want to know if i am crazy for reaching the conclusion i have., onto the view amp; x200b; to start, i am a christian, but that is not what decided what i believe., i came to the conclusion of abortions being generally wrong through my own train of thought that begins where i determine what i believe to qualify a human life., this qualification is in two factors that are relatively the same, but different wordings for those who want to hear it in different forms., 1., the maturing process i. e. the continuous process of growing 2., the possession of a future the reason i believe abortions are generally wrong is because the idea of an abortion is to end the maturing process and take away the future of the cell, group of cells, puddle of goo, whatever floats your boat., in simpler terms, a sperm cell and an egg cell do not have a maturing process that will lead to a full grown adult while apart; but, when they come together, that process is started and the possession of a future is now obtained., the reason i qualify these as my lynch pin qualities is because whenever that fertilized egg, or cell, or group of cells exists, it is maturing; and that process will only be stopped by some purposeful action or fatal mishap in the pregnancy., that process, that ongoing growth is the deciding factor in whether it is a 'life' or not because that process starts as soon as the egg is fertilized and does not end until the fully grown human dies., amp; x200b; now, here is why i kept saying 'generally wrong,' i do believe that abortions should sometimes happen, relatively., this means that, in some situations, choosing the lesser evil might be choosing the abortion., for an extreme example, if a young girl is taken and forced upon a pregnancy that will have a 90 chance of killing her if it goes through i know medicine isn't an exact percentage science, bear with me for the sake of explaining , and the baby has a minute 15 20 chance of surviving in comparison, then abort the baby., for another example, if my wife is pregnant, and complications say that she will have a 50 chance of death as well as the baby having a 50 chance of death if the pregnancy continues, then i will say abort the baby to ensure the 100 chance of survival of my wife because it is the lesser of two evils., in these situations, i will stand by the fact that they are not generally a right decision to make, but they are relatively right given the circumstances., to give a tougher example, i know that, if my wife was pregnant, and because of complications she had a 50 chance of survival as well as the baby having 50 , and the termination of the baby would mean an 80 chance of survival for my wife; i would choose to give the chance to my wife., yes, the percentages would weigh in the favor of keeping the baby at 50 50, but i know that love combined with the chance of being able to have kids later on would make me choose to give the higher single chance to her., amp; x200b; in conclusion, i believe abortions are inherently wrong in the general manner, but there are plenty of specific scenarios where i would say that abortions are the lesser of two evil, and should therefore happen., however, i do not believe that if some random teenager doesn't have the self control to use protection and gets pregnant, that they should be able to abort., i know that the mindset on this is 'her body, her choice,' but that is where it comes into play that i don't believe its just her body., amp; x200b; i'm sorry if there are plenty of grammatical errors in this, i couldn't get it off my mind so i typed this up late at night; but, i would appreciate any constructive discussion or points against or for what i have said., lastly, thank you for reading and spending your time on this, i greatly appreciate it :]</td>\n",

       "103208  [i am here to genuinely to gain a better understanding on other views about this subject., i know its a touchy one, but i have never been able to have a genuine discussion about this subject without getting insulted and hated before any constructive outcome can be made from it., that being said, if i seem like an absolute imbecile for the view you read, please tell me why, rather than the fact that you see me as an imbecile and that's it., my explanation of my view will begin through general statements that will be explained throughout the post, so please read through before replying and throwing your verbal chancla after reading that i simply believe 'abortions are generally wrong. ', i would lastly like to clarify that this is not a soapbox speech, this is not a crusade for my view, i simply just want to know if i am crazy for reaching the conclusion i have., onto the view amp; x200b; to start, i am a christian, but that is not what decided what i believe., i came to the conclusion of abortions being generally wrong through my own train of thought that begins where i determine what i believe to qualify a human life., this qualification is in two factors that are relatively the same, but different wordings for those who want to hear it in different forms., 1., the maturing process i. e. the continuous process of growing 2., the possession of a future the reason i believe abortions are generally wrong is because the idea of an abortion is to end the maturing process and take away the future of the cell, group of cells, puddle of goo, whatever floats your boat., in simpler terms, a sperm cell and an egg cell do not have a maturing process that will lead to a full grown adult while apart; but, when they come together, that process is started and the possession of a future is now obtained., the reason i qualify these as my lynch pin qualities is because whenever that fertilized egg, or cell, or group of cells exists, it is maturing; and that process will only be stopped by some purposeful action or fatal mishap in the pregnancy., that process, that ongoing growth is the deciding factor in whether it is a 'life' or not because that process starts as soon as the egg is fertilized and does not end until the fully grown human dies., amp; x200b; now, here is why i kept saying 'generally wrong,' i do believe that abortions should sometimes happen, relatively., this means that, in some situations, choosing the lesser evil might be choosing the abortion., for an extreme example, if a young girl is taken and forced upon a pregnancy that will have a 90 chance of killing her if it goes through i know medicine isn't an exact percentage science, bear with me for the sake of explaining , and the baby has a minute 15 20 chance of surviving in comparison, then abort the baby., for another example, if my wife is pregnant, and complications say that she will have a 50 chance of death as well as the baby having a 50 chance of death if the pregnancy continues, then i will say abort the baby to ensure the 100 chance of survival of my wife because it is the lesser of two evils., in these situations, i will stand by the fact that they are not generally a right decision to make, but they are relatively right given the circumstances., to give a tougher example, i know that, if my wife was pregnant, and because of complications she had a 50 chance of survival as well as the baby having 50 , and the termination of the baby would mean an 80 chance of survival for my wife; i would choose to give the chance to my wife., yes, the percentages would weigh in the favor of keeping the baby at 50 50, but i know that love combined with the chance of being able to have kids later on would make me choose to give the higher single chance to her., amp; x200b; in conclusion, i believe abortions are inherently wrong in the general manner, but there are plenty of specific scenarios where i would say that abortions are the lesser of two evil, and should therefore happen., however, i do not believe that if some random teenager doesn't have the self control to use protection and gets pregnant, that they should be able to abort., i know that the mindset on this is 'her body, her choice,' but that is where it comes into play that i don't believe its just her body., amp; x200b; i'm sorry if there are plenty of grammatical errors in this, i couldn't get it off my mind so i typed this up late at night; but, i would appreciate any constructive discussion or points against or for what i have said., lastly, thank you for reading and spending your time on this, i greatly appreciate it :]   \n",

they join to escape where they currently are and throw themselves into something else, they join because they were in the cadets and believe they were doing the right thing., i know people who were in the military, some of them are dickheads and some of them are the best people i'll ever know., and they've all been through and seen and done presumably terrible things., what i don't understand is how people praise war veterans for being heroes, serving 'our country', protecting 'our rights' ect ect., they don't serve our country, they serve capitalism, and the general public have done more than the military has every done for people's rights i'm from the uk and whilst we don't have as big of an attitude about veterans as a whole most agree we need to take care of them., and it's more about the fact that a lot of the time the us seem to see other countries attacking as a threat to their rights and so by stopping those threats it's seen as defending those rights., especially when they blame their bad habits and crappy personality on ptsd yes, ptsd is a very real and very scary mental illness but nobody ever forced you to sign up to go to war., i mean, some countries have the draft., and yes some blame shitty stuff on ptsd but sometimes it is an excuse., poor mental health breeds bad habits and without help to treat that then you are going to be liable to fall down the rabbit hole., and just generally it's hard for some to switch from a routine and life in the military to ordinary life., not for all but some do struggle., so many end up homeless from struggling to find a job and have ptsd and one of my friends, who i've mentioned before has it, he ended up in a really bad state after it got crippling and he couldn't distinguish between then and now., he was camped out in his living room thinking he was back there, he fell over so he couldn't move properly to get help and he was too out of it to get any., ptsd is major and whilst it has varying degrees of severity and not every soldier has it we should help those who do., it's a big thing where it used to be seen as weakness to be reluctant to kill and ptsd was seen as an even bigger weakness, men were executed for shellshock because they just thought they were being cowards and trying to get out of fighting., so now we make a big deal of it because it's a big deal and it's not something they should be ashamed of or punished for., why shouldn't we help them?, they get discounts and such as it's hard to find a job and because mental health is crippling., after everything they've been through what's the harm in giving them some extra help?, plus veterans have some of the highest suicide rates in america., but i dont think people who murdered other people deserve the world handed to them just because they wore a camo uniform while doing it., well that's a big statement., tell me, if someone is trying to kill you what do you do?, when you're fighting people who either do want to kill you because they think that's right or people who are soldiers just like you following orders but who will kill you the same way you'll kill them what are you meant to do?, before if you refused you used to be liable to be shot, there's stories from the world wars of people getting shot for running away or for sparring an enemy., there's even a tale where a soldier, a young one at that, used his rifle to block off the enemy from their trench he wasn't being a coward, he was slowing down the enemy but he got shot for cowardice., the point i was trying to make there is that they did what they had to do to survive, likely so did the other side and that they aren't just cold blooded killers., they had to do it to either survive or because of the consequences of not doing it., and also not all missions are you going and shooting at a bunch of people?, there's peace keeping missions where they're there to act as a proxy between two groups and try and maintain order, try and make it so kids can go to school and such., the army also act as relief during disasters and help out the effort then., maybe some people join because of that., and if you join as an 18, you can also join younger than that with permission, you have to do your service., you have an amount of time you legally have to do or you're a deserter., so a decision you make at eighteen to get an education, get out of a bad situation or because you want to be in the army means you stay., even if it becomes something other than what you'd thought., so i think they should receive the help they get and should have some degree of praise, although maybe not america's level., we have remembrance day to commemorate world war 1 and 2 and then all the soldiers serving as a whole along with the poppy campaign to raise charitable funds for them.]</td>\n",

', , hey, at the end of the day she still benefits simply from being born the way she is, if she doesn't like that there is an ulterior motive, that's her problem., i honestly fail to see how white heterosexual women are not the most privileged demographic, i have seen time and time again that they face the least struggles in life., i want to at least see how i, a white middle class heterosexual male living in canada am more privileged in certain areas of life than women of my same social class.]</td>\n",

', and that's true, but it's not like men had a choice whether to go to war., nor was being a 'houseman' a valid choice for most of history., what i'm getting at is that it's not men oppressing women, it was leaders oppressing plebs, both men and women, though here i argue that male plebs had it way worse.]   \n",

       "4  [i'm gonna start this off with some links: ic now i do want to point out right off the bat that i am fully aware that the primary reason as to why males suffer more in the western world is admittedly their own problem in the sense that most men don't really care to stick up for themselves and or are ok dealing with it., that being said, i still firmly believe that white heterosexual women are the most privileged demographic, as evidenced by the links i provided., the reason i say white heterosexual women is because i am comparing women from all around the world, you get women in africa who are at a constant risk of being abducted into sex slavery as well. as mutilation., and you you get women in the middle east who are treated as second class citizens and are viewed as a property, i am fully aware that these women in those parts of the world are oppressed, too bad the feminists in the western world don't give two squirts of piss about them and only care about their own interests back in their cozy democratic environments., i must also add that if said white heterosexual woman is 'attractive' she is gonna be given far more free rides and benefit of the doubt., the common argument against this is 'oh they just want to get something out of her! ', , hey, at the end of the day she still benefits simply from being born the way she is, if she doesn't like that there is an ulterior motive, that's her problem., i honestly fail to see how white heterosexual women are not the most privileged demographic, i have seen time and time again that they face the least struggles in life., i want to at least see how i, a white middle class heterosexual male living in canada am more privileged in certain areas of life than women of my same social class.]   \n",

', sure, perhaps i earn all the money in the household and my wife doesn't have to work., nice for her, sucks for me, right?, maybe not this means i also control the finances, get to make the financial decisions, and have a level of power over my wife that i can abuse., i can keep money in an account she can't access, i can threaten her to with divorce leaving her destitute, i can control what money she has access to as a way to control her activities., this dynamic may be more physically taxing on men in terms of hard labor, but it's a dynamic that quite clearly gives men the power., historically, women have been flatly denied basic rights on the grounds that they are women the right to read and be educated, the right to vote, the right to own land or property., men have not been denied these rights on the basis of their being male., men being sent off to die in war is a poor example in these discussions because it puts the cart before the horse., is conscription a violation of human rights?, surely but the point isn't that it should be kept and be extended to women, it's that it should end altogether., it seems you're relying on a vague standard of 'hardship' to define 'oppression. ', living a short life of poverty is not inherently oppression., dying in a war is not inherently oppression., scrounging for food is not inherently oppression., men, grim and brutal though their lives may have been historically, have always enjoyed society's fullest assumption of aptitude and provision of rights., women may not have been sent into battle, but they still died in war, and lived otherwise equally grim lives alongside their husbands all the while being functionally and often legally the property of their fathers husbands.]   \n",
       "1  [surely it depends on the military and the country, how do you feel about non active roles?, or engineers on the front lines?, or bomb squad?, or k9 handlers?, or medical personale?, most of them would be considered veterans too., there are specific parts of the military, like the coast guard or similar sectors that are dedicated to helping people, and i find those okay., they're dedicated to helping people in a different way., and you can't definitively say all veterans are bad., they're people, they're people and there'll be good and bad people amongst them., most don't join because they want to kill people, they don't join because they want to go out and shoot a bunch of people they join because maybe that's their only chance at going to college or getting a good job, they join to escape where they currently are and throw themselves into something else, they join because they were in the cadets and believe they were doing the right thing., i know people who were in the military, some of them are dickheads and some of them are the best people i'll ever know., and they've all been through and seen and done presumably terrible things., what i don't understand is how people praise war veterans for being heroes, serving 'our country', protecting 'our rights' ect ect., they don't serve our country, they serve capitalism, and the general public have done more than the military has every done for people's rights i'm from the uk and whilst we don't have as big of an attitude about veterans as a whole most agree we need to take care of them., and it's more

want to point out right off the bat that i am fully aware that the primary reason as to why males suffer more in the western world is admittedly their own problem in the sense that most men don't really care to stick up for themselves and or are ok dealing with it., i don't consider this a very constructive perspective, because treating large demographic groups as if they would be 'blameworthy' for the path that they take, is a flawed way to compare ongoing societal trends to personal choices that an individual makes., the real issue isn't that men as a whole 'choose to' perpetuate these damages, but why ?, modern western gender disparities, are not different in kind from the countries where you say women are oppressed., things are more comfortable for both genders , when we live in prosperity, and the laws are nominally more egalitarian, but the cultural roles are still polite, muted, fading versions of the same ones that leave women as sex slaves and the property of men., men become homeless, because they are presumed to be the home providers in the first place., women have the privilege to be part of the furniture., if in the third world you call that oppression, then it still is in the first world, or it isn't one in either., men are dismissed as abuse victims, because they are presumed to be the dominant member of the household., less so in the west than in the third world, but then again, the west is the only place that is starting to question it's prejudices, and provide shelters for men too at all., you can say, that even in the third world, women were privileged over men because they got to live as dependents, instead of having to fight in wars, do hard manual labor, and die early., or you could say that they were oppressed, because all that system was ultimately denying them power., but the latter case is still true in the first world., the perks of being a woman are held by the kind of traditions that still presume that women have less power over society, which does happen to be the case., if you don't call that a male privilege here, then neither is it even in harsher world, that only shines a light on it's logical conclusion.]   \n",

' sure, perhaps i earn all the money in the household and my wife doesn't have to work. nice for her, sucks for me, right? maybe not this means i also control the finances, get to make the financial decisions, and have a level of power over my wife that i can abuse. i can keep money in an account she can't access, i can threaten her to with divorce leaving her destitute, i can control what money she has access to as a way to control her activities. this dynamic may be more physically taxing on men in terms of hard labor, but it's a dynamic that quite clearly gives men the power. historically, women have been flatly denied basic rights on the grounds that they are women the right to read and be educated, the right to vote, the right to own land or property. men have not been denied these rights on the basis of their being male. men being sent off to die in war is a poor example in these discussions because it puts the cart before the horse. is conscription a violation of human rights? surely but the point isn't that it should be kept and be extended to women, it's that it should end altogether. it seems you're relying on a vague standard of 'hardship' to define 'oppression. ' living a short life of poverty is not inherently oppression. dying in a war is not inherently oppression. scrounging for food is not inherently oppression. men, grim and brutal though their lives may have been historically, have always enjoyed society's fullest assumption of aptitude and provision of rights. women may not have been sent into battle, but they still died in war, and lived otherwise equally grim lives alongside their husbands all the while being functionally and often legally the property of their fathers husbands.   \n",
       "1  surely it depends on the military and the country, how do you feel about non active roles? or engineers on the front lines? or bomb squad? or k9 handlers? or medical personale? most of them would be considered veterans too. there are specific parts of the military, like the coast guard or similar sectors that are dedicated to helping people, and i find those okay. they're dedicated to helping people in a different way. and you can't definitively say all veterans are bad. they're people, they're people and there'll be good and bad people amongst them. most don't join because they want to kill people, they don't join because they want to go out and shoot a bunch of people they join because maybe that's their only chance at going to college or getting a good job, they join to escape where they currently are and throw themselves into something else, they join because they were in the cadets and believe they were doing the right thing. i know people who were in the military, some of them are dickheads and some of them are the best people i'll ever know. and they've all been through and seen and done presumably terrible things. what i don't understand is how people praise war veterans for being heroes, serving 'our country', protecting 'our rights' ect ect. they don't serve our country, they serve capitalism, and the general public have done more than the military has every done for people's rights i'm from the uk and whilst we don't have as big of an attitude about veterans as a whole most agree we need to take care of them. and it's more about the fact that a lot of the time the us seem to see other countries attacking as a threat to their rights and so by stopping those threats it's seen as defending those rights. especially when they blame their bad habits and crappy personality on ptsd yes, ptsd is a very real and very scary mental illness but nobody ever forced you to sign up to go to war. i mean, some countries have the draft. and yes some blame shitty stuff on ptsd but sometimes it is an excuse. poor mental health breeds bad habits and without help to treat that then you are going to be liable to fall down the rabbit hole. and just generally it's hard for some to switch from a routine and life in the military to ordinary life. not for all but some do struggle. so many end up homeless from struggling to find a job and have ptsd and one of my friends, who i've mentioned before has it, he ended up in a really bad state after it got crippling and he couldn't distinguish between then and now. he was camped out in his living room thinking he was back there, he fell over so he couldn't move properly to get help and he was too out of it to get any. ptsd is major and whilst it has varying degrees of severity and not every soldier has it we should help those who do. it's a big thing where it used to be seen as weakness to be reluctant to kill and ptsd was seen as an even bigger weakness, men were executed for shellshock because they just thought they were being cowards and trying to get out of fighting. so now we make a big deal of it because it's a big deal and it's not something they should be ashamed of or punished for. why shouldn't we help them? they get discounts and such as it's hard to find a job and because mental health is crippling. after everything they've been through what's the harm in giving them some extra help? plus veterans have some of the highest suicide rates in america. but i dont think people who murdered other people deserve the world handed to them just because they wore a camo uniform while doing it. well that's a big statement. tell me, if someone is trying to kill you what do you do? when you're fighting people who either do want to kill you because they think that's right or people who are soldiers just like you following orders but who will kill you the same way you'll kill them what are you meant to do? before if you refused you used to be liable to be shot, there's stories from the world wars of people getting shot for running away or for sparring an enemy. there's even a tale where a soldier, a young one at that, used his rifle to block off the enemy from their trench he wasn't being a coward, he was slowing down the enemy but he got shot for cowardice. the point i was trying to make there is that they did what they had to do to survive, likely so did the other side and that they aren't just cold blooded killers. they had to do it to either survive or because of the consequences of not doing it. and also not all missions are you going and shooting at a bunch of people? there's peace keeping missions where they're there to act as a proxy between two groups and try and maintain order, try and make it so kids can go to school and such. the army also act as relief during disasters and help out the effort then. maybe some people join because of that. and if you join as an 18, you can also join younger than that with permission, you have to do your service. you have an amount of time you legally have to do or you're a deserter. so a decision you make at eighteen to get an education, get out of a bad situation or because you want to be in the army means you stay. even if it becomes something other than what you'd thought. so i think they should receive the help they get and should have some degree of praise, although maybe not america's level. we have remembrance day to commemorate world war 1 and 2 and then all the soldiers serving as a whole along with the poppy campaign to raise charitable funds for them.   \n",

modern western gender disparities, are not different in kind from the countries where you say women are oppressed. things are more comfortable for both genders , when we live in prosperity, and the laws are nominally more egalitarian, but the cultural roles are still polite, muted, fading versions of the same ones that leave women as sex slaves and the property of men. men become homeless, because they are presumed to be the home providers in the first place. women have the privilege to be part of the furniture. if in the third world you call that oppression, then it still is in the first world, or it isn't one in either. men are dismissed as abuse victims, because they are presumed to be the dominant member of the household. less so in the west than in the third world, but then again, the west is the only place that is starting to question it's prejudices, and provide shelters for men too at all. you can say, that even in the third world, women were privileged over men because they got to live as dependents, instead of having to fight in wars, do hard manual labor, and die early. or you could say that they were oppressed, because all that system was ultimately denying them power. but the latter case is still true in the first world. the perks of being a woman are held by the kind of traditions that still presume that women have less power over society, which does happen to be the case. if you don't call that a male privilege here, then neither is it even in harsher world, that only shines a light on it's logical conclusion.   \n",

       "2  i think this is where your problem lies. you believe people are making more money from the federal reserve than they are from it. you think that a surplus income should be reduced. in reality, the surplus income is still higher due to the federal reserve. it's also because of the fact that lower earning people in the state are more dependent on it for many reasons, such as inflation.   \n",
