       "3  [you may receive a lot of hate, but i am going to assume that you came here out of an honest attempt to have a discussion., 1 my thoughts in my head i cannot think about supporting such unnatural, disgusting, degenerate acts such acts as homosexuality or cutting your dick off, taking hormones and calling yourself a woman this is a bit of circular logic i do not support unnatural homosexuality because it is unnatural., can you elaborate more on what makes the act of homosexuality unnatural to you?, homosexuality does occur in nature., 2 its not traditional for the most of human history homosexuality was not accepted and still isnt, in most of the world and thats for good reason homos cant have children, and if they adopt one a household with transgender,gay,lesbian people are fucked up have you heard of the gay uncle theory?, i am summarizing, but basically homosexual males help the survival of the family., they are a supporting, helping hand that does not necessarily directly reproduce, but ensure that the family continues to survive., as for the not traditional aspect there are a lot of behaviors that change as society changes., are we to accept everything that was done in the past as the correct way of doing things?, or is humanity allowed to change?, 3 religion all major religions islam,christianity,judaism ban homosexuality, and i think god knows the best for us do you support and practice all of the teachings of the bible and the quran?, 4 accepting lgbt might mean accepting other degenerates if we accept these people today who guarantees we arent accepting zoophiles and pedos tomorrow?, in general, zoophiles and pedophiles have a victim when they express their urges., who is the victim in homosexuality?]   \n",

       "3  you may receive a lot of hate, but i am going to assume that you came here out of an honest attempt to have a discussion. 1 my thoughts in my head i cannot think about supporting such unnatural, disgusting, degenerate acts such acts as homosexuality or cutting your dick off, taking hormones and calling yourself a woman this is a bit of circular logic i do not support unnatural homosexuality because it is unnatural. can you elaborate more on what makes the act of homosexuality unnatural to you? homosexuality does occur in nature. 2 its not traditional for the most of human history homosexuality was not accepted and still isnt, in most of the world and thats for good reason homos cant have children, and if they adopt one a household with transgender,gay,lesbian people are fucked up have you heard of the gay uncle theory? i am summarizing, but basically homosexual males help the survival of the family. they are a supporting, helping hand that does not necessarily directly reproduce, but ensure that the family continues to survive. as for the not traditional aspect there are a lot of behaviors that change as society changes. are we to accept everything that was done in the past as the correct way of doing things? or is humanity allowed to change? 3 religion all major religions islam,christianity,judaism ban homosexuality, and i think god knows the best for us do you support and practice all of the teachings of the bible and the quran? 4 accepting lgbt might mean accepting other degenerates if we accept these people today who guarantees we arent accepting zoophiles and pedos tomorrow? in general, zoophiles and pedophiles have a victim when they express their urges. who is the victim in homosexuality?   \n",

       "1                                                  you're talking about making one payment on a utility, then add another on top, and then make more at low cost loans at higher prices. it sounds like you are saying that it should be free to withdraw money when the utility falls due to poor decision making. that's an absolutely horrible idea, if the utility falls due to poor decision making. the central bank provides free loans to the local bank in exchange for providing their services to local governments, like the us government. the central bank gives cash to local governments, and then you can borrow the money to your local government.   \n",

       "4  again, not everyone can accept that this behavior is legal. a fine for someone convicted of rape may be enough to change their mind, but in this case, someone convicted of rape should have the right to be held by another person for a very long time. you can't just force someone to be your victim. not everyone will agree that this behavior is okay or immoral, but this was necessary in the case of the gorilla. it's not clear what the right to have sex is, which is why if this thing exists and we're talking about just the gorilla killing people for no reasons, it might be more than a case of why i don't think we should tell it to anyone.   \n",
